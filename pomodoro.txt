* meta
i'm ari gold.

this is my workflow file. it's an outline mode file for emacs which
is pretty simple, the more asterisks the deeper the nexting.

i'm kinda using the pomodoro technique here. i'm not just doing 25
minutes though, i'm going to try different times. same with breaks.

* next up

** UPDATE about page and redo README.md
that is, get some direction and flow

ivy is a tool for teaching

** MACRO remove bootstrap_form gem
because it's another layer & another dependency
AND I should know how to do it first

* goals
** TEST test new Date method
** META compare ivy to ivy-rails
models, specifically student and lesson
controllers
views

** MACRO get lesson page up, ie. copy lessons/show.rhtml

** FEATURE track activities

** FEATURE don't reload the whole <body>
the nav bar shouldn't get updated on every page refresh
https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
and maybe this too,
https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/

** FEATURE context sensitive help
when a specific type of route is hit* we need to update the help <div>

** FEATURE make table headers sortable
especially for lessons#index. boy wouldn't it be nice if you could
view your pool of lessons in different ways?
** FEATURE link_to_sorter replacement

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19968638/refactoring-ruby-on-rails-link-to-with-sorting

** FEATURE list lessons by date, then time
** DESIGN where appropriate create should redirect to index, not show

really, i need to look into movement. that is, where each action
should redirect to

** MACRO use rails variants, new in 4.1!
http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html#action-pack-variants

** DESIGN buttons - back, new, edit, all of 'em

http://alexwolfe.github.io/Buttons/



* tests
** creating lessons

* archive
** FLOW switch Sqlite to PostgreSQL
so that production and development are the same. that way i can just
move the database around if there are issues.
** CORE create multiple lessons
Tue May 20 12:49:23 PDT 2014
looks good. need to write tests.

need to extend Date in order to parse the date_select
time_select

** MACRO something like `heroku reset database`

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export

steps:
1. heroku pgbackups:capture
   this will capture what's live
2. heroku pgbackups
   to see what's been captured
3. curl -o latest.dump `heroku pgbackups:url`
   get the latest. look around devcenter.heroku.com for getting
   earlier ones
4. pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d ivy latest.dump
   that'll do it!

** FEATURE enrollments
TEST the create and destroy actions

** BUG nav buttons change url from /action to /<model>/action
TEST each nav link

this only happens when show-ing a model. that is, showing a student
will cause the bug but indexing students won't.

** BUG the home page isn't getting today's lessons

   Lesson.todays is wrong

   use the console to figure it out
** new should redirect to index, not show
** redo pomodoros to calculate time and summarize days
** figure out why flash isn't working when making new attendances
** clean up attendance* views & make some data
** generate attendance & attendance types models
** start using time management
** make the forms prettier
** figure out why :time isn't going into new lessons
* time tracking

first attempt. gonna work for 20 minutes and then take a 3 - 5 minute break.

went ok for the first time. i'm liking it.

*** 20 START Mon May 12 12:06:06 PDT 2014 END Mon May 12 12:26:06 PDT 2014
this is inverted. i've got a stopwatch going and i'm going to see how
much work i can do before i get interrupted and we have to leave for
noisette.

after 10 minutes anni finished feeding mira. we'll see how long i can
work with mira in the jumper.

man oh man, she's cute. and, ergo, distracting. hmm.

so i did about 20 minutes. i could have gone longer but i'm trying to
stick to 20.


*** 25 START Mon May 12 14:31:59 PDT 2014 END Mon May 12 14:56:59 PDT 2014
i'm doing a 25 now. maybe a 30 at one point? i wonder what that number
should be. maybe it depends..

i restarted because may came home a few minutes into it.

*** 25 START Mon May 12 16:28:32 PDT 2014 END Mon May 12 16:53:32 PDT 2014

so far so good!

this is evening working with ema here and anni in and out. i'm just
curious to see how much work i can get done.

second day. 

got interrupted with about 4 minutes left 'cause ema's in the airport
getting jacked by united.

*** 18 START Tue May 13 10:30:43 PDT 2014 END Tue May 13 10:48:47 PDT 2014
free form for now 'cause ema's in the airport getting jacked by
united. also, anni'll be home in maaaaybe 30. maybe 40. maybe 20. ah,
time.

ok, she somehow got on a better flight. well done. no screaming either
she said. if i understand the story correctly, the woman who told her
that she won't make it on the plane was the one who wound up walking
ema to the plane. she also supposedly laughed publicly about ema's
chances though grains of salt shall be used. with the whole story, but
heck, she's on that flight.

stopped 'cause anni got back

*** 25 START Tue May 13 11:47:44 PDT 2014 END Tue May 13 12:12:44 PDT 2014
back downstairs. i'm wondering if i just shouldn't work it here 'cause
heck, it's gonna be hot. and then there's less transfer time.

lunchtime!

*** 25 START Tue May 13 13:31:24 PDT 2014 END Tue May 13 13:56:24 PDT 2014
it's quite amazing how easily i get delayed. aba called and we had
another conversation about remote work and other things. then he
called again. and i also had some stomach issues - kinda shows ya how
important good health is. it literally takes pomodoros away. i should
see yakov one of these days.

i wonder about this pomodoro stuff. always 25 minutes? what if i'm in
the middle of something awesome and could do 3 more minutes? or what
if those 3 minutes turn into 15 more minutes?

i think the point is to not get distracted. a timer helps with that.

i also think breaks are important.

and i also think that it's important to have a good sense of both the
macro level of whatever the work is as well as the micro. the mind can
get lost along an unproductive track.

*** 25 START Wed May 14 12:00:14 PDT 2014
i'm having trouble doing the 25 minutes straight. i got hungry a few
times. i suppose this would (will) be easier eating on a schedule.

hmm.

*** 25 START Wed May 14 12:10:14 PDT 2014
oof. at this point i really need to just put the time down i start and
stop working on ivy. i'm gonna try that
